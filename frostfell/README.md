# FROSTFELL

A deckbuilding trek through the long winter. Lead a caravan of wardens across a
frozen world: counter-based card battles, charms, waves, and a deck you rebuild
every run.

Landscape only, built for a phone held sideways. One file — `index.html` carries
the markup, the CSS, the fonts and the whole game.

## The rules, briefly

- **The board** is two lanes deep, three columns a side. Column 0 is the front,
  nearest the middle of the table. A swing hits the **front-most foe in the
  attacker's own lane**; if that lane is clear it reaches across, and a unit
  with nothing in front of it will walk into the lane where the fighting is
  rather than stand there.
- **One action per turn.** Play a card, ring the redraw bell, or pass. There is
  no mana — the turn *is* the cost. Moving a warden already on the board is
  free, and so is calling in the next wave early.
- **Counters** are the clock. Every unit counts down one per turn; at zero it
  triggers — ability *and* swing — then resets. A counter driven to zero by a
  card fires immediately, which is where the combos live.
- **Resolution order** is fixed and visible: every foe before every warden,
  front of the table before the back, top lane before bottom. The ORDER toggle
  numbers the board so you can read it before you commit.
- **The redraw bell** throws your hand away and deals a fresh one. It costs the
  turn unless it has charged (four turns without ringing), in which case it is
  free.
- **Waves.** Fights arrive in more than one piece. The wave clock is on the far
  side of the table; CALL pulls the next one in early, which is often the
  strongest play on the board — a wave that lands on your terms is half a wave.
- **Hurt.** A warden that falls comes back with half its attack and half its
  health, and shakes it off by seeing a whole fight through. Damage carries
  between fights; camps and the trader mend it.
- **Combos.** Kills inside one turn are counted together and paid for. Clearing
  a board in a single action is the play the whole game points at.
- **Charms** bolt permanently onto a card. **Sigils** put that warden on the
  board before the first bell. **Bells** are run-wide and chosen after a beast
  falls — an extra card each hand, a slower wave clock, a fatter purse.
- **Events** are forks in the road: a shrine, a stopped caravan, a hot spring,
  a bell in a dead tree, somebody else's fire. Every option is a real trade.

## Teaching, sound, and feel

A first run comes with hints that watch rather than block — each waits for the
player to do the thing it names, stays up long enough to read even when the
action that clears it has already happened, and the whole sequence goes away
with one tap. HOW TO PLAY is a three-page rulebook covering the fight, every
status and every keyword; it is on the title screen and behind `?` in a fight.

The score is a step sequencer, not a loop: three voices over sixteen steps with
the root, scale and tempo chosen by where you are — and it runs on its own
randomness, because a run has to play the same way twice.

## Layout of the source

`index.html` is one script in twelve numbered sections — utilities, palette,
statuses, card data, state, the battle engine, the run layer, juice, rendering,
input, audio, boot. The section index sits at the top of the script.

Nothing is loaded from disk. Every creature in the game is drawn by one
procedural renderer (`drawCreature`) from a recipe — silhouette, ears, mouth,
markings, props — so the whole cast comes out of the same sketchbook and scales
to any screen without a single image file.

## The typefaces

Two families, cut from source in `tools/frostfont/` and embedded as WOFF:

- **Frostcut** — the display face. Heavy, condensed, faceted bowls, icicle
  wedges on the arms.
- **Frostwork** — the UI face, regular and bold. Tall x-height, flat-cut
  terminals, built to survive an 11px label.

```
node tools/frostfont/build.mjs             # rebuild + re-embed
node tools/frostfont/build.mjs --check     # fail if the embed is stale
node tools/frostfont/build.mjs --specimen  # write fonts.html
```

## Tests

```
npm run test:frostfell    # rules, render, teaching, and a bot that plays whole runs
npm run test:frostfont    # rebuilds both faces and byte-compares the embed
```

The suites run headless against the real functions through `window.FF` — there
is no second implementation of the rules to drift from. `frostfell_run` is also
the balance instrument: it prints wins, zones reached and turns per fight.
